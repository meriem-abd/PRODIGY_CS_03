<h1>Password Complexity Checker</h1>
a tool that assesses the strength of a password based on criteria such as length, presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Provide feedback to users on the password's strength.

<h2>Importing the re module:</h2>'import re' imports the regular expression (regex) module, which is used for searching patterns in strings.
Defining the check function that takes one argument, password.

<h2>Password criteria Check:</h2>
<p>length = len(password) >= 8 checks if the password length is at least 8 characters. The result is a boolean value (True or False).</p>
<p>lower = re.search(r'[a-z]', password) is not None uses regex to search for at least one lowercase letter in the password. re.search returns a match object if the pattern is found, otherwise None. is not None converts this to a boolean value.</p>
<p>upper = re.search(r'[A-Z]', password) is not None does the same as the lowercase check but for uppercase letters.</p>
<p>numbers = re.search(r'\d+', password) is not None checks for the presence of at least one digit in the password. The regex pattern \d+ matches one or more digits.</p>
<p>special = re.search(r'[!@#$%^&*(),.?":{}|<>]', password) is not None checks for at least one special character from a predefined set of special characters.</p>

<h2>Criteria List:</h2>
criteria = [length, lower, upper, numbers, special] creates a list containing the results of the above checks.

<h2>Calculate Password Strength:</h2>
strength = sum(criteria) sums up the boolean values in the criteria list (where True is considered as 1 and False as 0) to determine the overall strength based on how many criteria are met.

<h2>Determine and Print Password Strength:</h2>
<p>An if-elif-else block evaluates the total strength score and prints a corresponding message:</p>
<p>5 criteria met: "Very strong password"</p>
<p>4 criteria met: "Strong password"</p>
<p>3 criteria met: "Moderate password"</p>
<p>2 criteria met: "Weak password"</p>
<p>Less than 2 criteria met: "Very weak password"</p>

Provide Feedback on Unmet Criteria:
The if statements following the if-elif-else block print specific messages for each criterion that is not met, guiding the user on how to improve their password.

<h2>Prompt for User Input:</h2>
password = input("Enter your password: ") prompts the user to enter their password.

<h2>Check Password and Provide Feedback:</h2>
check(password) calls the check function with the user-provided password to evaluate and provide feedback.
